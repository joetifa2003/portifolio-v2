                    Hello! My name is Youssef and I enjoy creating things that
                    live on the internet. My interest in web development started
                    back in 2015 when I decided to convert an android app to a
                    website â€” turns out hacking together a simple website taught
                    me a lot about HTML, CSS & JavaScript!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Fast-forward to today, and i have learned alot about web
                    development and I have worked on alot of side projects!
