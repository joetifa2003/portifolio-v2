My interest in web development started back in 2015 when I decided to convert an android app to a website â€” turns out hacking together a simple website taught me a lot about HTML, CSS & JavaScript! Then i started to learn vue js and used firebase as my backend did a lot of small projects then transitioned to react js with Typescript, Since then i used Typescript in all of my projects and never looked back.\nFast-forward to today, and i have learned a lot about web development and I have worked on a lot of side projects to improve myself in UI/UX and productivity in general. But not all my side projects is for the web. Right now i'm working on a compiler for my language written in Rust and having a lot of fun doing it!",
